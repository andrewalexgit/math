# Matrix Arithmatic
Scripts that provide arithmatical computations of matrices.

[1] Matrix Multiplier >> This C++ program will accept a 2D matrix (Arrays) and multiply them effectively.

[Notes]
    Let n = number of dimensions, and Matrix_A = 1 < n < 3 dimensions ^ Matrix_B = 1 < n < 3 dimensions.
    Let k = maximum number of elements in the matrices, -INT32_MAX < k < INT32_MAX
    
[Info]
    This program is intended to make scientific research easier by quickly computing and printing results of changing             verticies of mathemtical DiGraphs.
