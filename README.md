# Matrix Arithmatic
Scripts that provide arithmatical computations of matrices.

[1] Matrix Multiplier >> The script is designed to take arrays that are in the second dimension ONLY.
    Let n = number of dimensions, and Matrix_A = 1 < n < 3 dimensions ^ Matrix_B = 1 < n < 3 dimensions.
    Let k = maximum number of elements in the matrices, -INT32_MAX < k < INT32_MAX
